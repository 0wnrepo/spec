## One time bounties ##
Bounties are treated like expenses, with 1 board member “discount”:

1. 1 board member can put a bounty of up to $500
2. 2 board members can put a bounty of up to $1000, as long as no objections are raised
3. 3 board members can put a bounty of up to $2000, as long as no objections are raised
4. And so forth…

(Note that this is just a copy-paste of the normal Voting Rules tab, with 1 less board member per line).

The Executive Director has the voting power of 2 board members for the purpose of approving one time bounties.

## Discretionary Funds ##
The board may approve a member (such as the Executive Director) to have a larger pool of discretionary funds by unanimous vote

## Objections ##
If an objection is raised, time must be allowed for discussion, and all members must vote if there is still disagreement after discussion. Under no conditions will more than $20k be spent over the objection of any board member.

## Change of these rules and composition of the board ##
A unanimous vote is required to change these rules, or to change the composition of the board

## Documentation of expenses ##
ALL expenditures must be itemized in our public-facing budget spreadsheet (or equivalent)
