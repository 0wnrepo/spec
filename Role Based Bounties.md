Role Based Bounties
===================

A role based bounty or RBB is the term we use for someone who receives an ongoing bounty for filling some role for the project.

This is the [DA](http://wiki.mastercoin.org/index.php/Decentralized_Application) equivalent of an employee in traditional companies.

Right now the Mastercoin Foundation is managing RBBs, but management of RBBs will move over to the protocol Proof of Stake voting as soon as that's implemented.

The reason an RBB exists is to complement the traditional bounty system. We want to encourage people to work on the project full time, and even quit their day jobs, and for this they require some stability and predictability which the one-time bounty system doesn't really offer.

# How it works right now

* The Foundation decides to allocate a new Role Based Bounty, and they choose a person to fulfill that role.
* [The specific terms are on this Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AosWigpBxkwZdHhBaUtTZV9MWUpMVWV6U3VJV1RPbmc&usp=sharing#gid=0). The current terms are all identical and include 6000 monthly USD (paid usually in bitcoin), and some number of Dev MSC depending on the relative amount of MSC distributed that month. This will change for future hires that come into the project at a later phase.
* The payment schedule is bi-weekly, usually via bitcoins (but we can pay via other means if needed e.g. wire transfer).
* Each RBB also wins a proportional amount of the Dev MSCs. The amount they receive is proportional to the relative share of their USD/BTC allocation, out of all the Bounty BTC awarded that month. (David has a Google Spreadsheet for that).

The following standard conditions apply to all RBBs:

* The position is "at will", meaning both the Foundation and the RBB can terminate the RBB position without any reason.
* We do set a mutual 30 days notice period. Both the Foundation and the RBB are obligated not to terminate this RBB position without giving a 30 days notice.
* We generally intend to keep RBBs on for a long time, typically a year or more. However note that just like most jobs, this is not a contractual obligation given the items above.
* RBBs do not qualify to receive any other outstanding bounties in addition to what's already awarded to them via the RBB position.
* RBBs may manage teams, and the team may qualify for outstanding bounties. Each team's budget should be managed independently of the team lead's personal funds. 

# The Future

Like everything else, we will decentralize any central control to the RBB protocol. All of the above will be codified in a Proof of Stake voting system, and it will become part of the official Mastercoin spec.
